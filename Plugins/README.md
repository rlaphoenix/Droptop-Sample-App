# Plugins

This folder contains any Plugin required by your Custom App.

Note:

1. You do not need this folder if you do not need any Plugins.
2. Plugins pre-installed by Droptop Four do not need to be placed here:
   - Backlight.dll
   - Chameleon.dll
   - Drag&Drop.dll
   - FrostedGlass.dll
   - GetActiveTitle.dll
   - IsFullScreen.dll
   - MouseXY.dll
   - PowershellRM.dll
   - WebNowPlaying.dll
3. The dll version for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions should match.
4. It is encouraged to provide a dll for both 32-bit and 64-bit but is not strictly necessary.
   - Without the 32bit DLL, Rainmeter running under 32-bit even on 64bit machines will not be supported.
   - Without the 64bit DLL, most modern machines will not be supported.
