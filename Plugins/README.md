3. The dll version for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions should match.
4. It is encouraged to provide a dll for both 32-bit and 64-bit but is not strictly necessary.
   - Without the 32bit DLL, Rainmeter running under 32-bit even on 64bit machines will not be supported.
   - Without the 64bit DLL, most modern machines will not be supported.
