A Sample Custom App for [Droptop Four](https://github.com/orgs/Droptop-Four).

This Sample App was originally created by [@Cariboudjan](https://github.com/Cariboudjan) and has been
copied here as a Template Git repository for easier use and to encourage an open-source environment for
Custom Apps.

Most Custom Apps I find for Droptop Four are GitHub links that are effectively just used as a download
link for an `.rmskin` file.  
This discourages the contributional nature of Git, GitHub, and Open-Source in general. Without the ability
to read, modify, and contribute changes to the rmskin contents, it defeats the purpose of Git, but may even
be against the TOS of GitHub under the [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/github-acceptable-use-policies).
